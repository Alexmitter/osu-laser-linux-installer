Update: It took stupidly long and I am sorry for that, but the script is working again.
Lets hope it stays this way for a long long time.
I try to find some time to improve other issues with this project.

A new Dependency Installing Process is now included, the Ubuntu 18.04 Script should be the base for porting it to other distros.
Ports are welcome as a Pull Request, name the folder and script as i gave the example with ubuntu18.04.

I tested the script on a brand new Virtual Machine and i was able to make it a one click install. No problems what so ever. But apart from that, the script is untested. If you have any issues with it, please make a issue.

osu!lazer is the new early development open source version of osu!

This script helps you build, maintain and play on the latest build without any stress on your favorite Linux distribution.

## Easy instructions for new users

`sudo apt install dialog git`

`git clone https://github.com/Alexmitter/osu-lazer-linux-installer.git`

`cd osu-lazer-linux-installer`

`bash start.sh`

If you run it the first time, select Install Dependencies and select your distro, the script will automaticall install everything needed. 

This is currently only supported f√ºr Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 and should work on all flavors of those.
